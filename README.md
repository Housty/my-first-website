# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

The project was created to establish the skills obtained in html and css so far, whilst learning how to use Gitpod and GitHub
as a mechanism to manage all future projects in my development.

The sites provide a useful source of current development coding technologies that will be utilised during the Full Stack Development 
Diploma course.

It provides a link to each coding technology and will redirect you to the Wikipedia site, providing you with information relevant to
that technology as a quick and easy reference site.

Technologies utilised during the project are:

html - Hypertext Markup Language
css - Cascading Style Sheets
Gitpod & GitHub
